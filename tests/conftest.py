=================
Pytest configuration and shared fixtures.

This file is automatically loaded by pytest before any tests run.
pytest-django reads DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE from pytest.ini,
so we don't need to do anything here for basic setup.

This file exists as a placeholder for future shared fixtures
(e.g., pre-created users, API clients, etc.).
