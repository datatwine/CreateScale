# E402: module-level import not at top of file
#       Your codebase has mid-file import blocks throughout views.py, settings.py etc.
#       This is a structural pattern, not a bug. Cannot be auto-fixed.
#
# F403: wildcard import (`from .settings import *` in settings_sqlite.py)
#       Intentional — settings_sqlite.py inherits everything from settings.py.
#
# F405: may be undefined from star import
#       Side-effect of F403 in settings_sqlite.py (BASE_DIR comes from the * import).
